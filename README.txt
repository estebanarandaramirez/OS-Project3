OS - PROJECT 3 
Esteban Aranda (earandaramirez) & Nicholas Hollan (nchollan)
------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 1:
Work in progress for Phase 1 of the project. Assumptions made: simulations can last up to 1440 seconds (24 hs in the simulation) and a pirate/ninja can return to the shop a maximum of 20 times. For the randomized times: in the case of arrival time, we are utilizing the user input as a base and adding a random number between 1 and 1440 to it. For costuming times we are using that as a base to create random numbers around that value. 
To compile the project type "make" when in the appropriate directory. To run the program, the user has to input "./phase1_project3 #costumingteams #pirates #ninjas costumingTimePirates costumingTimeNinjas arrivalTimePirates arrivalTimeNinjas". For example:
./phase1_project3 3 20 12 15 5 10 10
To clean the project type "make clean".
